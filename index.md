# START MARKDOWN
This is a project in Mu Learn to use Markdown
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor
## How do i create a header in markdown?
I can create headers in markdown by using 1 - 6 hashes (#) and a space between the hash and what i want to write.
If i were to write # hello
# Hello
would be the output
similarly ,
putting 2 hashes ## hello would be
## hello
3 hashes would be 
### hello
and 4 would be
#### hello
5 would be
##### hello
and 6 would be 
###### hello
